## Railway Configuration Files

Create these files for better Railway integration:

**railway.toml** (in project root):
```toml
[build]
builder = "dockerfile"

[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"
```

## Estimated Cost
- Free tier: Good for testing
- Production: ~$5-10/month for both services
